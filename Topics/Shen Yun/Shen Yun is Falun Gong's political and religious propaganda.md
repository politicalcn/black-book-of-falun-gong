David Bachman, an international studies professor at the University of Washington who specializes in Chinese politics, stated that Shen Yun is a "soft approach in trying to interest people in their practices and win people over".

Shen Yun cares more about publicity than the show itself, as evidenced by Shen Yun’s spending. In 2017, the San Francisco Falun Dafa group reported $3.9 million in sales, while spending $2.2 million on advertising for Shen Yun. Spending such a high percentage of expected revenue on marketing "just defies logic", said Bill Pearce, assistant dean of UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and its chief marketing officer. [1]

Taylor Dorrell of the Columbus Free Press wrote, "Unsuspecting Columbus residents will likely be puzzled when the dance performance at the Ohio Theatre turns into a politically loaded religious advertisement." [2]

Shen Yun shows contain a lot of political and religious propaganda, such as the examples below.

"Chairman Mao appeared, and the sky turned black; the city in the digital backdrop was obliterated by an earthquake, then finished off by a Communist tsunami. A red hammer and sickle glowed in the center of the wave. [...] a huge, bearded face disappearing in the water, [...] a tsunami with the face of Karl Marx." This is how Jia Tolentino described a Shen Yun show. [3]

David Robertson described it similarly: "colourful Falun Gong practitioners in the park were beaten up by the black clad villains with the Chinese Communist symbols on their back. Or when a massive (digital) wave with an ominous picture of Karl Marx threatened to overwhelm the city, until the light (in the form of Li Hongzhi, the Falun Gong leader), dispersed it and destroyed him". [4]

The show had a violent scene of policemen beating people, portraying the alleged persecution of Falun Gong. [5]

Isaac Stone Fish of Foreign Policy states that "Shen Yun exists to transmit a message: that heavenly forces will destroy modern-day China, obliterating the Chinese Communist Party". [6]
