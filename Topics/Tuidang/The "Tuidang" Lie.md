# Introduction
The Falun Gong operated a "Global Service Center for Quitting the CCP". It reported that more than 400 million people who have withdrew from the Party, the League and the Young Pioneers. However, the data is exaggerated.

# Theoretical problems
In a response to Daniel W. Drezner, Stephen Gregory from the Epoch Times said that deceased CPC members can quit, ex-CPC members can also "quit", assumed names were also counted. This indicates that one can put names of other people and that the Tuidang Movement is unsure about the legitimacy of the names. [1]

The same person can declare “quitting” the Party multiple times. It is also impossible to verify the names. [2]

# Tuidang data
When sampling 481 Tuidang statements with locations, Caylan Ford counted 96% that were inside China (including Hong Kong and excluding Taiwan) and 4% that were outside China (including Taiwan). [1] Free News, which seems to be affiliated with Falun Gong, gives a similar number: 10% were outside. (https://sites.google.com/site/freepnet/9ping/tuidangaq).

If the ratio is applied to the 2021 Tuidang count, which was more than 380 million [2], more than 15.2 million people outside China (including the population of Taiwan) would have quit the CPC organizations and more than 364.8 million have done so in mainland China (including Hong Kong and excluding Taiwan).

There were 10.7 million overseas Chinese in 2021 (descendants excluded because they are almost certainly not members of CPC organizations). [3] The population of Taiwan in 2021 was more than 23,000,000. [4] Therefore, the total population of Chinese outside China (including the population of Taiwan) is a little more than 33 million (10.7 million + 23 million). In 2021, the population count of China was 1.4126 billion. [5]

This indicates that around 26% of the population in China (including Hong Kong and excluding Taiwan) and about half of the population outside China (including the population of Taiwan) has quit the CPC organizations.

According to The Epoch Times, the Tuidang center's data shows that about 99% of Tuidang statements come from China. [6] In this case, at least 376 million of the Tuidang statements come from China. This is equivalent to about 27% of the population in China.

According to The Epoch Times, in 2015, there were 1.5 million Tuidang statements each month. [7]

# Tuidang and society
Most Chinese people don't like Falun Gong, as evidenced by the following. Falun Gong has failed to generate lasting sympathy from the Chinese American community, where some label the Falun Gong as a fringe group. "They’re visible because they have devoted members, but they don’t have a large following," said Yong Chen, who teaches history and Asian American studies at UC Irvine. "The perception among many people is that the Falun Gong is not equivalent to human rights." [8] According to Yan Sun, a political science professor at Queens College, Falun Gong is a fringe group that has limited acceptance among Chinese people. [9] According to Radio-Canada, people in Chinatown felt uncomfortable with Falun Gong. [10] Therefore, the previously calculated data are false and Tuidang's data is false too.

The other issue with Tuidang's credibility is that only Falun Gong media initially reported about it. In 2022, most attention to it still originates from Falun Gong media. Some non-Falun Gong media have covered it. Most did without determining whether it is credible or not. Some presented examples, but they may be not enough to represent the general Chinese population.

Personally, I have not seen any Chinese person support Falun Gong in real life.

# Comments on Tuidang
Most commentators who have critically analyzed the Tuidang campaign's numbers doubt its truthfulness. David Ownby, a Falun Gong expert, doubted the Tuidang campaign: 

I know of no way to verify such claims independently, and find it such diffcult to believe that a Falun Gong newspaper could have such an impact within China. [...] On my recent trips to China, however, I must say the fall of the party does not seem imminent. [1] 

In 2006, Li Yi, a Hong Kong-based democratic activist, questioned The Epoch Times's claims about the number of resignations, because the numbers indicate that in ten years, the number of resignations would have surpassed the number of Communist Party members. [2]

Shi Lei of the China Democracy and Justice Party called the Three Withdrawal's numbers "fake". [3]
