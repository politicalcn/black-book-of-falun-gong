Around December 6th, 2004, on overseas Falun Gong BBS websites, a user named "孟伟哉" posted a message titled "孟伟哉宣布退出共产党！". Then, Boxun, Kanzhongguo, Renminbao and Sound of Hope have published the news of "Meng Weizai quitting the Party". [1]

On December 8th, another message titled "孟伟哉最后的声明" was posted. [2]

On December 11th, a statement titled "本网特别受权：孟伟哉严正声明永做共产党人" was published by Xinhua. This statement, which was read by Meng Weizai in front of reporters, denied the claim that he quit the Party. [3]

The next day, overseas websites published "孟伟哉痛斥：“中国共产党党员孟伟哉严正声明”是新华网伪造的", claiming that the statement published by Xinhua is fake. [4]

At the end of 2004 and at the start of 2005, overseas websites published a statement of "50 old comrades quitting the Party", which was signed by "Meng Weizai". The names were 邓力群、余秋雨、郑伯农、周良沛、陈涌、柯岩、魏传统、李尔重、朱仲丽、王季青、王泽民、李真、华楠、张常海、栗栖、彭绪一、邓斌、欧阳山、张器友、贺敬之、徐肖冰、胡可、瞿维、胡朋、钱丹辉、魏巍、朱子奇、陆梅林、刘绍棠、程代熙、刘朝兰、麦辛、江波、陈志昂、潘仁山、柳萌、郑永惠、栾保俊、刘金、刘梦溪、方家文、刘荣庭、梵扬、楼栖、徐乐义、黎洪、陶有法、贾文昭、侯波、马文瑞. [5] Among them, there were 6 people who were already dead during the publication. [3] It also included Deng Liqun, who is called the "Leftist King" in China.

Is it difficult to verify the identity of the author of the quitting statements, because articles on Boxun can be posted anonymously. Xinhua's statement, which was read by Meng Weizai in front of reporters, is more reliable than the claims than Meng Weizai has quit the Party.

The statement of "50 old comrade quitting the Party" decreases the credibility of the claim, because 6 of the alleged authors were already dead and it was very unlikely that some of them were against the Party. Phoenix TV found that the names were copied from a petition. [3]

In 2011, Meng Weizai participated in a celebration of the 90th anniversary of the CPC, which disproved the claim again. [6]
