In 2005, Minghui claimed that the characters 中國共產党亡 (Death of the Communist Party of China) were written on a stone in Pingtang County (Guizhou, China). [1] A song was then posted on Falun Gong websites. [2]

There are traces of at least one more character after the sixth character. [3] It is more probable that the characters were 中國共產党萬歲 (Long live the Communist Party of China).

The sixth character's shape does not match 亡 for the following reasons:
 - Its top part looks like 苗 (matching 萬) rather than 亠 (matching 亡).
 - The strokes on its left part match those of 萬 rather than those of 亡, which would have a 亠 protruding the 𠃊.
