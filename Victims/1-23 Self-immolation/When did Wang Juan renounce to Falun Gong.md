In the interview with Wang Juan, it was stated that Wang Juan quickly was quickly “transformed” (很快就转化过来) in a detention center.[1] Wang Juan said to the BBC that she abandoned Falun Gong 10 minutes after entering the labor camp (进入劳改营只有10分钟就决定放弃法轮功). [2]

These are two different events. In fact, Wang Juan was first sent to a detention center in 2000 for “disturbing social order”, then sent to a labor camp after the self-immolation in 2001, when she still believed that the self-immolation was righteous. [3]
