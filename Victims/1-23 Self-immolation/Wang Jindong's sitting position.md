To achieve the double-leg crossing position, one must sit the “posture of the Chinese military soldiers”, then cross the legs into the correct position. This requires some effort and is probably impossible to do while enduring the lack of oxygen caused by the fire.

When Wang Jindong used the term “dapan” when talking to reporters, he possibly did so to refer to “double-leg crossing”.

Note: at the Changchun Fa Conference in 1998, when talking about Falun Gong practitioners, Li Hongzhi said: “我知道有许多人连单盘都盘不上的” (“I know many people who can’t even do the half lotus pose”). In the following photos of Falun Gong practitioners from Minghui’s website, many of them do not sit correctly:
