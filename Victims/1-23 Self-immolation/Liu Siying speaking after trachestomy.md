Speaking with tracheostomy is possible. The Passy-Muir valve is commonly used to help patients speak. When the patient breathes out, the valve closes and air flows around the tracheostomy tube, up through the vocal cords allowing sounds to be made. [1]

Liu Siying had difficulty speaking during the interview with reporters. For example, when she named the book “Zhuan Falun” (responding to the reporter's question), she had to repeat it twice to be heard, and each time the words sounded like “huàn… huǎ… wén” in Pinyin.
