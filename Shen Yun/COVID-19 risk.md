During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shen Yun had large gatherings that increased the risk of COVID-19 infections. This risk was increased even more because Falun Gong recommends people to say "Falun Dafa is Good, Zhen Shan Ren is Good" to cure COVID-19.

Falun Gong's Vision Times showed that the audience of a Shen Yun show in March 2022 was densely packed and many of them did not wear masks. [1]

Falun Gong's Epoch Times showed that none of a Shen Yun troupe, which had completed 34 performances in 9 places in Japan, arrived in Korea without wearing masks while they were close to other people. [2]
