Someone who saw Shen Yun in Fresno wrote on Yelp: "Be warned: Religious sermon!" "I WALKED OUT as soon as anti-evolution statements were made on the screen. False advertising!" Another wrote: "I rate this a Zero star. This show is purely CULT PROPAGANDA. Do not waste your money and time for this". [1]

Ruthy N. wrote about a performance in San Francisco: "[...] it was repetitive and schlocky [...] AND, definitely filled with proselytizing of the very bizarre Falun Gong cult."

The Evening Standard wrote: "You could overlook the politics if the show was any good, but it is dated and sentimental, with comically bad comp√®res, laughably awful film projections and dance routines that would make panto producers blush." [3]

In 2018, Colin Dabkowski of Buffalo News wrote: "[Shen Yun] remains crushingly dishonest about its intentions and woefully underwhelming as a theatrical experience." "The cultural significance of those dances [...] holds undeniable interest for Westerners. But after 2 1/2 hours, the dancing often becomes repetitive" "The hosts (not listed in the program) deliver creaky intros to most numbers, each one a failed effort to connect with the perceived comic sensibilities of American audiences." [4] In 2008, Sarah Crompton called Shen Yun's first show in Britain "a horribly Disneyfied version of the traditional Chinese culture it seeks to celebrate". She also wrote: "what I really object to is that such a politically motivated performance is being smuggled on to stages around Europe in the name of family entertainment [...] the promised acrobatics are few and far between. The best of the routines - some ferocious drummers, a Mongolian bowl dance, a Tibetan dance of welcome - are those that are simplest and least admonitory. The rest are tainted by the baggage they are asked to carry." [5]

Judith Mackrell of the Guardian wrote: "Even if you are sympathetic to the Falun Gong cause, there is something creepy about the evangelical tone with which this is delivered. It is also made worse by the fact that the show's visual style is like a Disney production, with the cast dressed in gaudy, glittery updates of traditional costumes backed by scenes of soft-focus landscape created by computer animation." [6]

Susan Walker of the Toronto Star wrote: "Art it wasn't. The choreography was consistently banal, with the performers arranged in rows doing identical gestures. The dancers were under-rehearsed and unremarkable."

Commenting Shen Yun's show at Shea's Performing Arts Center in 2010, Colin Dabkowski wrote: "Imagine what it might be like to watch a synchronized swimming team perform in front of a gigantic Windows 95 screen-saver." [8]

A person who has watched a Shen Yun show at Montreal in 2013 stated: "I realized in the middle of the show that it was linked to Falun Gong... I wish I had known before I spent $150". [9]
