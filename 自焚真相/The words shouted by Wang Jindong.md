Wang Jindong’s shouted “宇宙大法是世人必经之法” (the Cosmic Dafa [great law] is the Law that everyone must experience). Falun Gong questioned the fact that this sentence can not be found in any Falun Gong material.

In the 1997 Fa Teaching at New York, Li Hongzhi said: "我也知道将来学这个法的人特别的多，将来的人是人人都知道，不管你是白人也好，黄种人也好，还是什么人也好，肯定都知道。" ("I also know that people who study this Law will be numerous, everyone will know it in the future, no matter white, yellow, or other races, they will surely know.).

In the 1999 Eastern US Fa Conference, he said: "我讲的是真正宇宙中的理，人人都会被这部法所震撼。" ("What I teach is the Cosmic true law, everyone will be shocked by this law.")

In North American Fa Conference (北美首届法会讲法), Li Hongzhi said: "我们今天这个法却能度所有的众生回到他原来的位置，因为这是宇宙大法" ("Today, our Fa can save all sentient beings back to their original places, because this is the Cosmic Fa")

Li Hongzhi used the term "Cosmic Dafa" multiple times throughout his teachings, such as in the Singapore Fa Conference.

Because Wang Jindong’s words match these teachings, his slogan is not suspicious at all.
