Slower frame-by-frame playback of the footage shows Liu's arm bending and moving in the same direction as the object in the air. The flying object can be seen coming out of the extinguisher's substance at the exact spot where Liu Chunling's hand was located. At this moment, the arm of Liu Chunling is pointing towards the object. There is nothing else nearby, because Liu Chunling already distanced herself from the man behind her. Therefore, it is certain that the object was thrown by Liu Chunling and not by the man behind her. Furthermore, the object seemed to be very flexible. It is unlikely that it was hard enough to kill Liu Chunling.
