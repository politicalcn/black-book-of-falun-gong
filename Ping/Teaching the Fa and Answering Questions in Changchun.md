# Belittling other things
Student: If some practitioners do research on the Book of Changes, will their cultivation be interfered with?

Master: The things in there are just principles from our Milky Way galaxy, not greater principles. But the Fa we practice is greater—this Dafa is enough for you to research for a lifetime.

Student: Would it have any negative effects if I do the exercises while under the effects of the Lengyan incantation?

Master: I have said that reciting incantations is actually asking to be strengthened by that practice. You have my Falun and Law Body to take care of you, so what are you reciting that for? Do you want to stand in two boats at the same time? Do you want to add other things to your cultivation? Isn’t that your intent? You won’t gain anything that way.


# Anything can be explained by Falun Dafa
Student: Every time I think about Falun in my mind I shudder. Why does this happen?

Master: If one has animal or spirit possession, this might occur, but in the classes I got rid of them for the vast majority of our students, with the exception of the very few who still hadn’t changed their way of thinking and weren’t firm about cultivation. When I was getting rid of those things, I didn’t investigate further.

Student: When I practice the exercises, my body sways involuntarily.

Master: Don’t sway, don’t sway involuntarily. If you just can’t stop swaying, then open your eyes and the swaying will stop. Do this until you don’t sway anymore.

Student: While practicing Falun Dafa, especially while practicing the second exercise—Falun Standing Stance—my hands feel like they’re holding a mass of qi. If I don’t consciously control it, the mass of qi will pull the hands inward or sometimes push them outwards.

Master: This is the Falun turning. What you are feeling is just the feeling of the Falun rotating.

Student: When I feel the Falun in my body turning, sometimes it changes direction before it completes one circle. Some people feel the Falun turning more than a hundred times before turning the other way. Why does this happen?

Master: This is because in the beginning, when it is adjusting things in your body, the Falun doesn’t follow a set pattern. It is an intelligent being and knows how to adjust things for you, until you have been adjusted suitably. When your body is finished being adjusted, and after you are completely acclimated to it, it will quite naturally turn forward nine times and then backwards nine times. But at that point you won’t feel anything, you won’t always feel it. We all know that the stomach moves slowly, but do you feel your stomach moving? When [the Falun] becomes a part of your body, when you have adapted to it, you won’t feel its existence.

Student: As soon as I do the exercises, I sweat all over. Is this a good thing?

Master: Of course that’s good. Sweating by nature expels bad things, and it means that your body is hot. When people have health problems their bodies are cold. It shows that you have practiced well.

Student: When meditating there is a sound in my ears, and my mind goes blank.

Master: This is a good thing. It means that your distracting thoughts are gone—this is very good. But you have to be aware that you are practicing.

# Do everything for Dafa
Student: After my child attended the class he couldn’t continue to do the exercises. Will the Falun protect him forever?

Master: If a person can’t continue to do the exercises, then it won’t work, right? One has to keep doing the exercises. I came to save cultivators, not to specifically protect ordinary people.

Student: How many times should I do the exercises in one day?

Master: If you have time, then do more; if you don’t have time, then do less. However many times is okay. In the beginning, it’s better to do the exercises as much as you can. Your doing the exercises is strengthening the mechanisms. The true increase of gong, the changes in your body, and the strengthening of abilities are all results of the mechanisms that we installed in you. Your doing the exercises strengthens the power of the mechanisms.

Student: I didn’t attend the class. Will I see results if I frequently read the book and study?

Master: Those who didn’t attend the class, but can study on their own and are truly able to follow the xinxing requirements that guide practitioners as they cultivate, can achieve obvious results just the same.

# Buddha
Student: What’s the lowest Attainment Status of the Buddha school?

Master: The lowest Attainment Status of the Buddha school is that of the Arhat. Below that, there is no Attainment Status and the cultivator didn’t reach True Attainment Status and didn’t go beyond the Three Realms.
