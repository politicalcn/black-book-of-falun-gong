# Anything can be explained by dafa
Student: When I do the exercise, “Strengthening Divine Powers,” my lower abdomen sometimes undulates. It’s similar to the regulation of breathing that I experienced when I did other qigong practices in the past.

Master: Yes, it will be like that. Just do the exercises normally and don’t worry about it; it is a state. In the beginning, when Dafa regulates the breathing, it is automatic.

Student: Why is it that after doing the exercises, one hand feels hot and the other feels cool?

Master: This is a normal reaction. The Tao school talks about the clear separation of yin and yang. Perhaps this side is hot and that side is cool, or perhaps that side is hot and this side is cool—these are all normal states. All kinds of states will occur.

Student: No matter which exercise I practice, it always feels like there’s a lot of qi and blood intersecting and flowing in my brain. Is this the Falun turning, or is the Falun adjusting things in my cerebrum?

Master: Every kind of state will occur in a practitioner’s body, thousands upon thousands of states—so many they can’t be counted.

Student: While doing the sitting meditation, sometimes it feels like I’m becoming bigger and sometimes smaller.

Master: These are all good things. Once a person starts to practice, his master soul will have energy to fill him up, and he can then change. When he is expanding he will feel very big. But this flesh body of yours doesn’t change, the change is in another body, and it is he who feels as if he is very big. He can also shrink and become very small. Actually it’s all very normal, and I don’t want to explain these phenomena. There are many different states, more than thousands upon thousands of them.

Student: While doing the Strengthening Divine Powers exercise, my whole body will shake or a part will shake. Can I still practice?

Master: If your shaking is like trembling in fear, then perhaps there is some animal or spirit possession involved, and it is afraid. If it’s a normal, slow shaking of the body, then perhaps it is the energy current flushing the energy channels, but you shouldn’t shake along with it.

Student: There are two people who learned Falun Dafa from veteran students for a period of two months. Now, while doing the Strengthening Divine Powers exercise, they have the feeling of qi, and with that all kinds of movements appear.

Master: That is demonic interference—hurry up and get rid of those self-induced movements! Whenever someone does movements that are not of Falun Dafa while in a state of tranquility—of course, I’m talking about genuine cultivators of Falun Dafa—if your movements aren’t of Falun Dafa, you need to hurry up and get rid of them! You all see me doing the greater hand positions, and you want to learn them; some people feel that they can do the hand positions, too, once they give it a try. Let me tell you, it may very well be demons interfering with you, as my Law Body would definitely not teach you these things. And this is especially true for those who are involved with another practice: if this situation appears it is certainly interference.

Student: After I started attending the class, I heard a great noise in one ear, and there was qi rushing out of the other. Later when I went to sleep, I heard music. What happened?

Master: That’s just your Celestial Ear being opened. Your Celestial Ear was opened up, blown open by an explosion.

Student: When sitting cross-legged and doing the Strengthening Divine Powers exercise, my legs hurt very much in the beginning. At what point in my cultivation will the legs stop hurting?

Master: When you cultivate to the state of not having any more karma.

Student: After going into the Grand Hall of Shaolin Temple, the Falun in my lower abdomen rapidly rotated counterclockwise. What happened?

Master: Rotating clockwise and counterclockwise are both normal. It’s a really good place, a very good temple. Of course we won’t talk about the state of those monks who are cultivating now. What we are talking about is the temple being a very good temple.

Student: When doing the exercise position Holding the Wheel on Both Sides of the Head, I always hear ringing in my ears.

Master: That’s right. Holding the Wheel on Both Sides of the Head can open up people’s ears. Some people think, “That’s great, I’ll just do that every day.” This is an attachment! I don’t like to tell new students these kinds of things because it’s easy for them to develop an attachment to them. Once they become attached, they will be obstructed.

Student: At night when I’m practicing by myself with my eyes closed, when I think about how the surroundings are very quiet, I feel really afraid.

Master: Let me tell you, Falun Dafa is now known everywhere in every dimension. As Falun Dafa is being passed on in ordinary people’s society, there are many kinds of messed up things and things of many dimensions that want to take a look—they are strange and peculiar looking, there are all kinds of them. When you are practicing they will come and watch you, and you are so frightened that you feel the hair on your arms stand up. But remember that my Law Body is there and no one can hurt you, they just want to have a look. Why do you feel really scared? It’s because your subordinate soul sees them and is pretty scared. Actually it doesn’t matter at all.



# Extreme and deifying
Student: When we have practiced to a level beyond the Milk-White Body state, will we have the supernormal ability of sensing others’ bodies with our own?

Master: I have talked about this—that’s not a supernormal ability. For the vast majority of you here who attended my class, you passed the stage of the Milk-White Body before you even had a chance to feel it. Actually, I pulled you up and then pushed you forward to another stage. If you were to practice and go through this process by yourself, you’d have to practice for a lifetime. I finished doing it for you in eight days. The breakthrough in your levels was so rapid that it passed before you even felt it.

Student: I will be going to Hong Kong very soon. Will your Law Body protect me, your disciple?

Student: When items that we use from day to day are broken, is it creating karma and at the same time losing virtue, or just creating karma without losing virtue?

Master: Shakyamuni said that all things are sentient, and actually we see in other dimensions that everything is alive. If your Third Eye reaches the level of Law Vision, when you go outside or once the door opens you will see that even rocks and walls will speak to you and greet you. But I’m telling you to look at the big picture, cultivate confidently and with dignity, and don’t become attached to these little things. Humans have their own way of life. A true cultivator of Dafa can dissolve a lot of karma in one day. So for cultivators of Dafa, karma is not that frightening.

Master: It doesn’t matter if you go to Hong Kong, to America, or even off to the moon or the sun. My Law Body will be able to protect you. But don’t be attached to it—it is solely for the sake of your cultivation that my Law Body takes care of you.

Master: That’s just what you have come to know. That one path of the Golden Dan Great Way that people have talked about since ancient times is what ordinary people talk about. Everyone in the heavens knows that my Falun Dafa is the best Fa. Of course there are other cultivation ways—it’s extremely mysterious and profound. How could humans understand such things?

Student: How high is your gong power now? Have you personally experienced what you have talked about during your lectures?

Master: I have experienced so many things. If, let’s say, I have a yard, ten yards, or a hundred yards, then what I’ve revealed to you isn’t even an inch of it—you’re not allowed to know too much. True masters don’t flaunt themselves. What I’m teaching here is this Fa, and you should just conduct yourselves according to this Fa. And I can tell you, nobody who genuinely cultivates according to this Fa has incurred any problems, so just go and cultivate. In the past, at the Guizhou lecture I said something. Someone asked me, “Teacher, how high is your level?” I said, “Just go and cultivate. Since teaching the Fa publicly—actually, even before I came to the public—nothing has been able to budge me.” Simply because I said this, a three-hundred-year-old person from that area came to fight with me, out of jealousy. In the end he was done in. Even though he had been cultivating to the point of being three hundred years old, this Dafa being taught to the public is no laughing matter, and nobody is allowed to casually meddle with it. In the end he knew that I was saving people, but it was too late for him. The Fa couldn’t allow him to continue on.

# Teacher refuses to anwer
Student: The first day I did the exercises, I felt a round object enter my abdomen from the outside and then it slowly went towards my navel. Is this the Falun installed by the Teacher?

Master: Practitioners shouldn’t concern themselves with these matters. I can’t explain every kind of situation. Don’t add to your attachments.


# Isolation
Student: Can we cultivators still learn things from texts of Buddhism and Taoism?

Master: Absolutely not—it’s absolutely prohibited! Wouldn’t that mess everything up? Isn’t that going down a different path? You have to commit to one discipline. Of course you may say that you don’t practice Falun Dafa, and you use the principles of Falun Dafa to guide you in learning other practices. Of course, the Fa that I’m teaching can provide guidance for every kind of practice, since they all have to stress cultivation of xinxing as we do.
