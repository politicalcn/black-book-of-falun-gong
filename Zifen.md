# The possibility of self-immolation by Falun Gong practitioners
1) It is theoretically possible for Falun Gong practitioners to commit suicide

James R. Lewis pointed out that it is highly unlikely that these victims were paid. Considering many factors, he concluded that this was more likely “a demonstration planned and executed by local practitioners—though directly inspired by a combination of Li Hongzhi’s violent apocalyptic vision, his call to non-specific action against the Chinese government, and examples of prior religious suicides and protest suicides”.[1]

David Ownby noted that Li does not endorse suicide in any of his recent statements, “But a practitioner at the end of his or her rope in China could certainly see [the statements] as an endorsement for martyrdom, and perhaps choose his or her own means to achieve that.”[2]

Li Hongzhi’s “scriptures”, such as “走向圆满” (Towards Consummation), “忍无可忍” (The Limits of Forbearance), “去掉最后的执著” (Get Rid of the Last Attachments), were said to have encouraged self-immolation. The self-immolators wanted to reach heaven. Their goal was not suicide, but Consummation.[3]

2) Reports of Falun Gong practitioners that have self-immolated did not suddenly appear after the ban

Before the ban, official media reported many individual self-immolations: Liu Yongfeng (1997), Li Yumei (1998), Li Jinzhong, Chang Haochi, Sun Jie (1999).[4]

# Commentary on "suspicious points" alleged by Falun Gong
## Wang Jindong’s sitting position
Wang Jindong's sitting position was incorrect and was questioned by Minghui, who stated that only the full lotus and half lotus positions are used by Falun Gong and that Wang Jindong's sitting position is a soldier's one.[5]

Sitting in the wrong position does not necessarily prove that Wang Jindong was not a Falun Gong practitioner. As his daughter said, he lacked time and oxygen to do the full lotus pose when self-immolating.[6] This is a plausible situation that was ignored by Falun Gong.

Side note: at the Changchun Fa Conference in 1998, when talking about Falun Gong practitioners, Li Hongzhi said: “我知道有许多人连单盘都盘不上的” (“I know many people who can’t even do the half lotus pose”).[7] This proves that many of them are unable to sit in the correct position. In the following photos of Falun Gong practitioners from Minghui’s website, many of them do not sit correctly:

## Wang Jindong’s slogan
Wang Jindong’s shouted “宇宙大法是世人必经之法” (the Cosmic Dafa [great law] is the Law that everyone must experience). Falun Gong questioned the fact that this sentence can not be found in any Falun Gong material.[8]

In the 1997 Fa Teaching at New York, Li Hongzhi said: “我也知道将来学这个法的人特别的多，将来的人是人人都知道，不管你是白人也好，黄种人也好，还是什么人也好，肯定都知道。” (“I also know that people who study this Law will be numerous, everyone will know it in the future, no matter white, yellow, or other races, they will surely know.), and in the 1999 Eastern US Fa Conference, he said: “我讲的是真正宇宙中的理，人人都会被这部法所震撼。” (“What I teach is the Cosmic true law, everyone will be shocked by this law.”) Li Hongzhi used the term "Cosmic Dafa" multiple times throughout his teachings, such as in the Singapore Fa Conference.[9]

Because Wang Jindong’s words match these teachings, his slogan is not suspicious at all.

## Wang Jindong’s appearance
Minghui compared three photos of Wang Jindong and concluded that they were three different people.

The difference between the first one and the last one is explainable by aging. The second photo has a low resolution and therefore cannot be compared. The last photo has been widened so that Wang Jindong's face looks shorter. But other photos taken during the same period show that his head is taller, which matches the first photo. In Wang Jindong's interview video, his face strongly resembles the first photo.

Some of the characteristics have also been exaggerated by Minghui. These alleged differences are insufficient to prove that there were 3 different Wang Jindong's.

## Liu Chunling's indentity

Minghui claimed that “An investigative story published by the Washington Post on February 4, 2001, revealed that Ms. Liu Chunling, one of the immolators, had never practiced Falun Gong”.

However, the Washington Post article only stated that people have not thought that Liu Chunling practiced Falun Gong, and didn’t state that she never practiced Falun Gong.[11]

It was reported that she was “kept to herself”, indicating that she was isolated. The article also stated that “There were also questions about how Liu supported herself and about the whereabouts of her daughter's father”, indicating that neighbors did not know her well. Therefore, her neighbors' claims about her (such as beating her family members or working at a nightclub) are not reliable. Practitioners generally don't publicly practice Falun Gong because it may bring them consequences.

Even if these claims were true, they would not necessarily prove that she was not a Falun Gong practitioner, because it is not necessarily true that Falun Gong practitioners never do immoral things. Neighbors also said that she had psychological problems. If she beat her family members, it is probable that psychological problems caused it, regardless of whether Falun Gong forbids it or not.

## Fire extinguishers
Having fire extinguishers ready at Tiananmen square is normal. According to the police, each police vehicle in the bureau is equipped with fire-extinguishing equipment all year round.[12] For example, in 2011, police at Tiananmen Square pulled out fire extinguishers and stopped a self-immolation within 10 seconds.[13]
Did Wang Jindong really self-immolate?
Falun Gong questioned whether Wang Jindong's self-immolation was real and stated that Wang Jindong's hair and the bottle below him were intact.
CNN reported that “The CNN crew saw a man sit down on the pavement just northeast of the Peoples' Heroes Monument at the center of the square. After pouring gasoline on his clothes he set himself on fire. Police ran to the man and extinguished the flames”.[14] This corroborates the CCTV footage.
Wang Jindong’s front hair has been completely lost, which means that Wang Jindong’s hair did not remain intact.
According to Wang Juan, his daughter, the two bottles were attached to a nylon rope that was hung around his neck. The bottles were covered by two layers of clothing. He let the gasoline flow out of his clothes by cutting them. During the self -immolation, Wang Jindong was standing and the bottle fell down. Because the fire was quickly extinguished and the two layers of clothes covered the bottle, it remained intact.[15] This is a plausible situation that was ignored by Falun Gong.
The flying object behind Liu Chunling
Minghui claimed that a man striked Liu Chunling with an object.[16] However, slower frame-by-frame playback of the footage shows Liu's arm bending and moving in the same direction as the object in the air. The flying object can be seen coming out of the extinguisher's substance at the exact spot where Liu Chunling's hand was located. At this moment, the arm of Liu Chunling is pointing towards the object. There is nothing else nearby, because Liu Chunling already distanced herself from the man behind her. Therefore, it is certain that the object was thrown by Liu Chunling and not by the man behind her.

Furthermore, the object seemed to be very flexible. It is unlikely that it was hard enough to kill Liu Chunling.
Hospital treatment
In 2001, the Associated Press reported about victims of the September 11th attack: “The critically burned patients resemble mummies, wrapped in gauze and a foil-like bandage impregnated with germ-fighting silver.” The photo showed that the doctor did not wear a mask.[17] The Burn Support News reported that one of the patients was “breathing through a tube connected to a ventilator, was swathed in gauze, like a mummy, with only eyes, lips, fingers and toes visible.”[18]
In 2022, Jay Leno, a television host, was covered in gauze while being treated for third-degree burns. His entire face was covered in gauze.[19]
From these examples, it can be seen that wrapping patients in gauze is not suspicious at all.
Is Liu Siying suspicious?
Falun Gong pointed out that Liu Siying spoke to a reporter after reportedly undergoing a tracheostomy and claimed that this was impossible.
Speaking with tracheostomy is possible. The Passy-Muir valve is commonly used to help patients speak. When the patient breathes out, the valve closes and air flows around the tracheostomy tube, up through the vocal cords allowing sounds to be made.[20]
Liu Siying had difficulty speaking during the interview. For example, when she named the book “Zhuan Falun”, she had to repeat it twice to be heard, and each time the words sounded like “huàn… huǎ… wén” in Pinyin.[21]
Did CNN record the close up footage?
The CNN recording team was on Tiananmen Square. According to CCN, the crew was taping the events. The CNN article also included a photo of the self-immolations’ aftermath, indicating that CNN reporters were able to record the incident.[22] The Associated Press reported that CNN’s tape was confiscated.[23]
Section 3: More information disproving Falun Gong’s response
The Associated Press recorded the scene after the self-immolations. There were many people on the square, which means that it would have been difficult to stage a fake self-immolation like Falun Gong described.[24]
A Beijing arm of the Falun Gong strongly suggested that the self-immolators were Falun Gong devotees and said they “heeded a call from our master to strengthen our fight against evil”.[25]
A Washington Post article stated that, according to the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, all five victims except Liu Siying (Liu Chunling’s daughter) previously protested against Beijing's actions against Falun Gong. This indicates the self-immolators were Falun Gong practitioners.[26]

# Conclusion
All the main “suspicious points” reported by Falun Gong were not suspicious at all. The identity of the self-immolators were also confirmed to be Falun Gong practitioners. Falun Gong’s theory about this event is far-fetched, while the official reporting is plausible and backed by evidence.
