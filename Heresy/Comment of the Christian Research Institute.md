The Christian Research Institute determined the following:
 - Falun Gong may enable contact with demons;
 - Falun Gong resembles to New Age occultism;
 - Li Hongzhi portrays himself as divine, contrary to what the apostle Paul warned;
 - Li Hongzhi calls our world the "trash can of the Universe". In contrast, Jesus died for its people. Falun Gong's teachings are contrary to Christianity.
