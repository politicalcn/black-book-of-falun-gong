Li Hongzhi said that “I remember that in the Bible or in this In the same kind of books, both Jehovah and Jesus said this: Do not go east... Jesus said that you should not go east, meaning that they do not belong to us. Jesus told not to go east, and I also found that there are no Orientals in Jesus’ Kingdom of Heaven.” (Sydney Lecture) But the Bible states the opposite: “There above it stood the Lord, and he said: “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. 14 Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.” (Genesis 28:13-14) “The Lord will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.” (Isaiah 51:10) “I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 8:11) “27 All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him, for dominion belongs to the Lord and he rules over the nations.” (Psalm 22:27-28) Furthermore, Jesus was not Westerner, but Jesus was from the Near East.
