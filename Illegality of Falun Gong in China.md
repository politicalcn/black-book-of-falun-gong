The Chinese constitution states: "No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the State." [1]

Article 300 of the Criminal Law states: "Whoever forms or uses superstitious sects or secret societies or weird religious organizations or uses superstition to undermine the implementation of laws and administrative rules and regulations of the State shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years; if the circumstances are especially serious, he shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not less than seven years." [2]

In 1999, the "Decision on Banning Heretical Organizations and Preventing and Punishing Heretical Activities" was adopted.
